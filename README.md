# Django-Inline-Formset
Inline Formsets allow you to edit multiple instances of the child model that are related to a parent model, such as creating, updating, or deleting them together in a single form.
Inline formsets are designed for scenarios where you have a parent model and a child model with a one-to-many relationship.
Inline formsets are created using the inlineformset_factory function provided by Django.
