# Django-Inline-Formset
Inline Formsets allow you to edit multiple instances of the child model that are related to a parent model, such as creating, updating, or deleting them together in a single form.<br>

Inline formsets are designed for scenarios where you have a parent model and a child model with a one-to-many relationship.

Inline formsets are created using the inlineformset_factory function provided by Django.

This function generates a formset class that includes forms for both the parent and child models.

The formset class is based on the parent model's form and includes additional form fields for the child model.

The child model (the "many" side of the relationship) should have a foreign key field that establishes the relationship with the parent model((the "one" side of the relationship).The parent can have more than one child. It allows you to associate each child form with the correct parent object when saving the formset.

Management of multiple forms: Inline formsets manage multiple forms automatically. They handle form validation, formsets' management forms, and error rendering for all the forms in the formset.

<h4>Rendering and Handling:</h4>
When rendering an inline formset in a template, you can iterate over the formset forms using a loop.
Each form within the formset represents a child model instance associated with the parent model.
You can render the form fields for each child form and handle form validation and submission as you would with regular forms.

<h4>Creating, Updating, and Deleting:</h4>
Inline formsets provide a convenient way to create, update, and delete child model instances associated with a parent model instance.
You can dynamically add or remove child forms from the formset within the template using JavaScript or Django's formset management forms.
When saving the formset, it automatically handles creating new child objects, updating existing ones, and deleting removed ones.
